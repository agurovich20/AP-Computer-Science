0. Base represents the number of unique digits a system can combine to represent a value. 

1. Binary is a base-2 system using the digits 0 and 1 to represent values. In computing, binary is used because the digits 0 and 1 can be easily represented with the 
absence or presence of electric signals. 

2. Find the leading digit of the number and count how many digits follow it (i.e. for 1010 there are 3 digits after 1). Raise 2 to the power of the number of following 
digits (for the prevous example, 2^3). Repeat this for every remaining 1 digit and add the resulting numbers together. 
Ex.1010=2^3+0+2^1+0=10 

3. Divide by 2 until you can no longer do so. Write out the divisor as 2^a. Subtract 2^b from the remainder. Repeat until you reach 0. Write in base 2 such that for 2^a has 
a 1 digit in the a digits place.
